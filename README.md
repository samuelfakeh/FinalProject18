# Intro to Programming Final Project - Fall 2018

The Tic-Tac-Toe game seemed easy at first, but once I started to code, I realized that it was not as easy as it seemed. Questions like, how do I make the board, or how do I code the AI to know when to block or where to go. Step by step I figured out how to make the board, and put in the values, so that the player is able to place his X or O on the disered spot. I was able to get help from some of my friends, and two websites, but some things I had to do on my own. Overall I want to say it turned out well, but I was disappointed I was not able to complete the game on my own, no matter how many hours I put into it.
